# desktop-rdiff-backup
A simple rdiff-backup script for desktop usage

I have this script setup as a cron job to schedule weekly backups on all of my machines. So far it's worked out pretty well.

See REMOTE OPERATION section of rdiff-backup manual for explanation of '--remote-schema'.

This script was inspired by [Jonas Wagner's](https://github.com/jwagner) [blog post](https://29a.ch/2014/11/13/desktop-rdiff-backupscript) which helped me decide on using rdiff-backup instead of the many other options out there.
